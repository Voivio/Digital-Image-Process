# Digital-Image-Process

This is a repository for homework code of Digital Image Process B at 2019 spring.

## Homework 1

This homework has achieved basic interpolation algorithms, including nearest, bilinear and bicubic.

## Homework 2

This homework has achieved several typical space domain process algorithms.

Histogram equilization and some filters, such as mean filter and median filter.

Also, a sharpen algorithm using Laplace operator is written.

## Homework 3

This homework has achieved several typical frequency domain process algorithms.

A turbulence degradation model and reconstraction using inverse filting and Weiner filting is achieved.

A motion blur degradation model and reletive reconstraction is achieved.

## Homework 4

This homework has achieved some typical multiresolution analysis schemes.

A approximation pyramid and prediction residual pyramid generation system is written.

A simple fast wavelet transformation script is written, within which two function is defined: analysis bank and synthesis bank.

An application of edge detection is achieved.

## Homework 5

This homework has achieved some typical morphological image processing operations.

Categirized by the image being processed, binary image and gray scale morphological operations are written.

Applications like letter extraction, hole filling and border cleansing are achieved in binary morphological process.

Applications like top hatting, granulometry, and texture-based segmentation are achieved in gray scale morphological process.
